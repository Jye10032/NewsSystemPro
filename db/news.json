The US allowing Lin's unauthorized visit to New York during the UN General Assembly, providing a platform for \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces to provoke and stage attention-seeking performances, is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs, said Guo.</p><p>This action severely undermines the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiques, sending a seriously wrong signal to \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces. The Chinese side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this, said Guo.</p><p>Guo stated that the DPP authorities sent Lin to unauthorizedly visit New York during the UN General Assembly, where he was seen cozying up to Taiwan's so-called \"diplomatic allies\" and engaging with certain US politicians, attempting to curry favor and seek support from external forces for \"Taiwan independence.\" This political trajectory of relying on foreign powers for \"independence\" is glaringly evident, Guo said.</p><p>We warn the DPP authorities and the stubborn \"separatists\" that those who engage in unjust actions will ultimately bring about their own downfall; any attempts to provoke \"independence\" will only backfire and harm themselves, said Guo.</p><p>Guo also advised the few remaining so-called \"diplomatic allies\" of Taiwan island not to be repeatedly manipulated and used by the \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces. They should recognize that the one-China principle is the trend of the times and the will of the people. There is no future in being tied to the \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces, Guo said.</p><p>There is only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China. The international community's adherence to the one-China principle is unshakable, and the complete reunification of China is an unstoppable historical trend, Guo added.</p><p>Global Times</p>",

On Tuesday morning, the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center raised both storm and wave warnings to the highest red alert level early in the morning, this year's first dual red alert for marine disasters, while the ministry upgraded its marine disaster emergency response for Guangdong to Level I at 9 am.</p><p>China's disaster relief authorities, including the national disaster prevention commission, the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration, urgently allocated 60,000 relief items to Guangdong on Tuesday. The supplies include tents, folding beds, summer quilts, emergency lighting lamps, and household emergency kits, aiming to support the local area in properly conducting risk avoidance, relocation and resettlement of affected people as well as disaster relief and assistance work, People's Daily APP reported.</p><p>\"All schools in Foshan are closed today. In response to the typhoon, the local government has opened emergency shelters, ensured stable supplies of meat and vegetables, and kept prices steady. Our community has also distributed a typhoon safety guide,\" said a Foshan resident surnamed Liu.</p><p>A Shenzhen resident surnamed Su told the Global Times said his company switched to remote work on Tuesday afternoon. He noted that while many people were stocking up at supermarkets, shelves remained full and there was no sign of panic.</p><p>Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the SAR government activated its emergency response on Monday morning to carry out real-time monitoring, risk assessment, and formulate response measures. The government has announced the closure of all schools on Tuesday and Wednesday, and temporary shelters were open. Around 240 flood-prone locations have been inspected and cleared, 200 emergency drainage teams have been deployed, and pumping robots are on standby for immediate dispatch, according to China News Service (CNS).</p><p>He added that flight operations at Hong Kong International Airport would be sharply reduced starting the evening of Tuesday, with many flights canceled on Wednesday. However, the airport terminals will stay open 24 hours to serve passengers.</p><p>According to China Central Television (CCTV), in Macao, the four cross-sea bridges connecting the city to Taipa, as well as the Lotus Bridge, were closed at 6.30 pm. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge was closed at 3 pm on Tuesday, and all passenger ferry services were suspended. After issuing an orange storm warning at 1 pm, the Macao SAR government will also carry out an evacuation plan for low-lying areas, which is expected to be completed by 5 pm Tuesday.</p><p>Wang Gan, chief forecaster at the China Meteorological Administration, said Ragasa formed on the night of September 18 over warm waters east of the Philippines. In that area, sea surface temperatures exceeded 29 C and the warm water layer was deep, serving as an \"energy reservoir\" that fueled its intensification. Meanwhile, the convergence of the southwest monsoon and the easterly flow within the tropical convergence zone provided abundant moisture, and atmospheric instability supported strong convection. In addition, weak vertical wind shear along the typhoon's path helped maintain its warm-core structure, further accelerating its rapid strengthening, Xinhua reported.</p><p>Ren Guoyu, former chief expert at the National Climate Center and a professor at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), told the Global Times on Tuesday that China has been hit by more and stronger typhoons this year, linked to abnormally high sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific, a phenomenon often seen during La Niña years.</p>",

Its basic education development has reached the average level of high-income countries globally, and higher education has entered the universal stage with a 60.8 percent gross enrollment rate, Huai said during the press conference.</p><p>Meanwhile, Vice Minister Wang Jiayi said that during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, the Ministry of Education implemented the student physical fitness enhancement plan, promoting increased physical education classes, after-school sports services, and extended recess activities across regions.</p><p>Initiatives included introducing 15-minute breaks between classes, ensuring primary and secondary school students meet the requirement of two hours of daily comprehensive physical activity and widely organizing inter-class sports leagues. Monitoring results indicate that the physical health levels of Chinese students have generally stabilized with an upward trend, Wang said.</p><p>The officials specially mentioned the quality of meals in primary and secondary schools at the press conference. Wang said that the ministry has collaborated with relevant departments to carry out specialized campaigns to improve the quality of meals in primary and secondary schools.</p><p>Efforts have included issuing guidelines on campus food safety, organizing training for catering staff, upgrading canteen facilities, and promoting the establishment of parent committees for meal supervision in schools, Wang said, adding that a number of campus food safety incidents have been seriously addressed.</p><p>A Beijing kindergarten teacher, Shushu, told the Global Times that ensuring food safety is a top priority.

    "content": "<p>The market watchdog in Shenzhen, South China’s Guangdong Province on Monday warned about price gouging during typhoon days could be punished with fines of up to 3 million yuan ($421,827), Chinanews.com reported.</p><p>As Ragasa, the 18th typhoon of this year, makes its way toward the coastal area of South China, becoming the strongest typhoon to affect China so far this year, with its extreme intensity, wide wind field and extreme characteristics, the Shenzhen Administration for Market Regulation issued on Tuesday a notice of warning on market pricing behaviors. The notice emphasized maintaining price stability, especially for essentials such as vegetables, grains and oils, meat, poultry and eggs.</p><p>The administration reminds all business operators, especially those selling essential daily goods in farmers’ markets and supermarkets, to strictly comply with relevant laws and regulations, strengthen self-discipline in pricing, maintain a sound market price order and refrain from infringing on consumers’ legitimate rights and interests, or disrupt market price stability.</p><p>The administration banned fabricating or spreading rumors of price hikes, raising prices sharply without cost justification, and driving commodity prices excessively high. Hoarding daily necessities beyond normal quantities or storage cycles without legitimate reasons is also prohibited. In addition, businesses are forbidden from colluding or manipulating prices in ways that harm competitors or consumers.</p><p>Violations of clear pricing rules can result in fines of up to 5,000 yuan. Those engaging in price frauds may be fined up to 500,000 yuan. Those who fabricate or spread information about price increases, hike prices, hoard goods to drive prices up, or driving up prices too quickly or excessively may face a maximum fine of 3 million yuan. Collusion or manipulation that causes significant price increases may incur fines of up to 5 million yuan.</p><p>The regulator ordered businesses to strictly follow clear pricing rules, ensuring price tags are accurate, complete and correctly matched to goods. Practices such as inflated final prices, false discounts, inducements, or failing to honor price commitments are strictly prohibited.</p><p>The regulator urged all businesses to conduct self-inspections and make corrections in accordance with laws and regulations. The administration will step up supervision of market pricing during the typhoon period, strictly investigate and punish any violations that are not corrected after warnings, and seek joint enforcement with other authorities.</p><p>Last September, as super typhoon Yagi hit South China’s Hainan Province, a group of business operators, including hotels and hardware and electrical machinery stores, were exposed for violations such as price gouging and failing to clearly mark prices as required, according to a CCTV report.</p><p>Some hotels were found to have increased their room rates by four to five times during the typhoon compared with their usual prices, while some hardware and electromechanical stores raised prices and sold disaster-relief supplies such as generators, chainsaws, and electric saws without clearly marking prices.</p><p>Global Times</p>",

    "content": "<p>When asked to comment on Boaz Toporovsky, a member of the Knesset from the Yesh Atid, once again visited China’s Taiwan island, a spokesperson from the Chinese Embassy in Israel said on Sunday that, MK Toporovsky of the Yesh Atid, disregarding China’s strong opposition and solemn representations, once again visited Taiwan island and repeatedly made erroneous remarks regarding the Taiwan question.</p><p>These have seriously violated the one-China principle and undermined the political foundation of China-Israel relations. He has become a trouble-maker for the sound development of the bilateral ties. The Chinese Embassy in Israel strongly condemns his detrimental words and actions, according to release published on the website of the Chinese Embassy in Israel on Sunday.</p><p>There is but one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. The government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. The one-China principle is a prevailing international consensus and a basic norm governing international relations, said the spokesperson, according to the release.</p><p>This year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War, as well as the 80th anniversary of Taiwan’s return to China. Taiwan’s return to China is an integral part of the postwar international order. China’s sovereignty over Taiwan brooks no challenge. To clamor for “Taiwan independence” is to split the country, to support “Taiwan independence” is to interfere in China’s internal affairs, and to connive at “Taiwan independence” is to undermine the stability across the Taiwan Straits, said the spokesperson, according to the release.</p><p>During his visit to Taiwan this time, this MK met with Taiwan’s regional leader Lai Ching-te, ignorantly addressed him as “President”, and even claimed to speak “on behalf of the Israeli people” in expressing thanks to Taiwan, said the spokesperson, according to the release.</p><p>The China-Israel Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations clearly states that “the Government of the State of Israel recognizes that the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People’s Republic of China,” said the spokesperson, according to the release.</p><p>The spokesperson said that, this MK has repeatedly and blatantly violated the one-China policy upheld by the Israeli government, clearly acting on behalf of outside interests. His political credibility has been completely eroded, and he is not eligible to represent the others. We admonish this MK not to delude himself that he can harm China’s core interests and the national sentiments of the Chinese people without paying a price. If he does not rein in at the brink of the precipice, he will fall and be shattered to pieces, said the spokesperson, according to the release.</p><p>Global Times</p>",

    "categoryId": 1,
    "content": "<p>An Australian P-8A aircraft on Sunday intruded into China's territorial airspace over the Xisha Qundao without the approval of the Chinese government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theater Command organized naval and air forces to track and monitor the Australian aircraft, take powerful countermeasures and warn it away in accordance with laws and regulations, Senior Colonel Li Jianjian, spokesperson for the air force of the PLA Southern Theater Command, said in a statement on Monday.</p><p>The Australian move seriously violated China's sovereignty and could have easily triggered maritime and aerial accidents, Li said.</p><p>\"We urge the Australian side to immediately stop such provocative moves. The troops in the theater are on high alert at all times to resolutely defend national sovereignty and security and peace and stability in the region,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>Li's remarks came after the Australian side hyped up the incident.</p><p>A Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft conducting a maritime surveillance patrol in the South China Sea experienced an unsafe and unprofessional interaction with a PLA Air Force Su-35 fighter aircraft on Sunday, the Australian defense ministry claimed in a statement released on its website on Monday.</p><p>The Australian statement further claimed that the PLA Air Force aircraft released flares in close proximity to the RAAF P-8A aircraft, accusing the move as an \"unsafe and unprofessional maneuver that posed a risk to the aircraft and its personnel,\" but admitted that no injuries were sustained by Australian Defense Force (ADF) personnel nor was damage caused to the RAAF P-8A.</p><p>This is not the first time that Australia has made an accusation like this. Another similar case took place in earlier this year in February.</p><p>In response to Australia's accusation of a Chinese fighter jet's unsafe conduct in the South China Sea, dropping flares near an Australian air force plane on February 13, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a regular press conference at the time that the Australian military airplane deliberately intruded into China's airspace over Xisha Qundao without China's permission. The move violated China's sovereignty and undermined China's national security. The Chinese side took legitimate, lawful, professional and restrained measures to expel the airplane.</p><p>China lodged serious protests with Australia and urged it to stop infringing on China's sovereignty and making provocations and stop disrupting peace and stability in the South China Sea, Guo said at the time.</p><p>Wang Yunfei, a Chinese military affairs expert, told the Global Times on Monday that the Australian military aircraft came all the way to China's doorstep and even intruded into China's territorial airspace to conduct a maritime surveillance patrol, a move that undermined China's security.</p><p>It is totally legitimate for the PLA to take proper measures, including tracking, monitoring and expelling, Wang said.</p><p>By hyping up the Australian military aircraft's so-called \"unsafe and unprofessional\" interaction with the PLA Air Force, the Australian side is shifting the blame to the victim, Wang said.</p><p>Zhuo Hua, an international affairs expert at the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times that it is not the first time that Australia has sent military aircraft to intrude into China's airspace over the Xisha Qundao. This has become a \"standardized\" procedure of provocation, calculated mischief, and smear campaigns, serving as a common tactic for Australia to participate in the military containment and suppression against China.</p><p>Australia not only conducted military reconnaissance targeting the movements of China's surface and underwater vessels, it also deliberately obscured its operational airspace in public discourse, using so-called \"maritime surveillance patrol\" to mislead the international community. After encountering rights protection actions of the PLA, it distorted the truth to fabricate an image of being the victim and the innocent party, thereby undermining the international moral foundation of China's sovereign boundaries in the South China Sea, and damaging and harming China's image, sovereign interests, and military security, Zhuo said.</p><p>Zhuo said that Australia's repeated provocations actually highlight its diplomatic dilemmas and frustrations. Australia shares a broad foundation of common interests with China. However, as a staunch ally of the US, it also exhibits a strong dependency inertia toward the it and faces practical \"ally obligations.\" This makes it difficult for Australia to break free from the overarching US strategic competition track with China, compelling it to periodically demonstrate loyalty to the US through such blustering tactics.</p><p>Chinese military affairs expert Zhang Junshe told the Global Times that Australia dispatched military aircraft from afar to intrude into Chinese airspace for reconnaissance. On one hand, this aims to align with the US \"Indo-Pacific\" strategy, demonstrate loyalty to the US, and willingly act as a pawn of Washington, thereby stirring international public opinion to contain China. On the other hand, it also seeks to assert its presence by provoking China.</p><p>However, the PLA possesses sufficient naval and air capabilities to safeguard national territorial security and maritime rights and interests. Perhaps the next time Australia engages in such \"calculated mischief,\" it might encounter the J-20, Zhang said.</p><p>Zhang said that the term \"powerful countermeasures\" used by the spokesperson of the Southern Theater Command Air Force in the statement is a highly uncommon formulation. It is hoped that Australia will correctly interpret the PLA's statement, comprehend its warnings and expulsion measures, and refrain from repeatedly engaging in deliberate \"calculated provocations.\"</p>",

    "categoryId": 1,
    "content": "<p>US company General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) has been contracted by the US Navy to develop conceptual designs for a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) to support the US carrier air wing of tomorrow, Naval News reported on Sunday. A Chinese military affairs expert told the Global Times on Sunday that manned-unmanned teaming is a growing trend, noting that with China recently debuting loyal wingman drones and air superiority drones, China and the US are leaders in this field, which could significantly change the shape of warfare.</p><p>Citing a CA-ASI press release, the Naval News report said that GA-ASI was selected to work on US Navy CCA designs emphasizing a modular approach to platform selection, capable of being rapidly reconfigured and upgraded to meet changing mission requirements, including operations on and from aircraft carriers. GA-ASI's approach supports the US Navy's revolutionary acquisition strategy of smaller, frequent purchases that enable rapid technology insertion rather than traditional long-lifecycle programs, the press release claimed.</p><p>CCA is a term used by the US Air Force to describe what was often called loyal wingman drones, and now the US Navy is also ramping up developing CCAs.</p><p>CCAs are highly capable, semi-autonomous jet fighters that complement and enhance traditional, human-piloted combat aircraft. Produced in high quantities at comparatively low cost, they let commanders shift risk away from human flight crews, enhance the sensing and other capabilities of legacy aircraft formations, increase lethality of the air wing, and maximize operational flexibility across the board, according to the Naval News report.</p><p>The US Navy's CCA design will emphasize seamless coordination among manned fighters, uncrewed vehicles and support platforms; accommodate elevated risk profiles and reduce risk to crewed platforms; support and enhance 4th- and 5th-generation aircraft and complement 6th-generation aircraft; and maximize operational flexibility, cost efficiency and mission effectiveness, the report claimed.</p><p>Chinese military affairs expert Zhang Junshe told the Global Times on Sunday that the US Navy has been advancing the collaborative combat model of manned-unmanned teaming aircraft, in which the development of the CCA is a key component.</p><p>On one hand, unmanned combat aircraft can serve as aerial arsenals, carrying large quantities of ammunition to strike ground or maritime targets; on the other hand, the use of unmanned combat aircraft can reduce casualties, as they can be deployed in combat over sea and air domains with dense air defense firepower without the need to consider human losses, which is the greatest advantage of unmanned combat systems, whether in ground, air, or maritime warfare, Zhang said.</p><p>GA-ASI's Navy CCA contract follows its selection to design and fly the US Air Force's first CCA, the YFQ-42A. A production-representative unmanned fighter, YFQ-42A, was the first US Air Force CCA to begin flight testing in August, Naval News reported.</p><p>Song Zhongping, another Chinese military affairs expert, told the Global Times that the US Navy's decision to partner with GA-ASI could have been largely influenced by the company's existing foundation in developing CCA for the US Air Force.</p><p>\"It has been a normal practice to adapt air force aircraft designs to develop naval aircraft, although necessary adaptations must be made, Song said.</p><p>Zhang said that developing a naval aircraft from an air force version is an international development trend. This approach not only saves development costs, reduces development time by utilizing mature aircraft models to develop another military variant, due to similar performance and design philosophies, it can also more effectively enhance joint combat capabilities between the air force and navy.</p><p>China is also utilizing this concept, with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Forces' J-35A fighter jet and the PLA Navy's J-35 carrier-borne fighter jet, Zhang noted.</p><p>The US is not the only country that has been developing CCAs.</p><p>During China's V-Day military parade in Beijing on September 3, the PLA unveiled two previously unseen uncrewed combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) and two CCAs, \"highlighting China's continuing investment in uncrewed systems, US media outlet Aviation Week reported at the time.</p><p>According to official descriptions provided at the military parade, these aircraft are loyal wingman drones and air superiority drones.</p><p>An expert told the Global Times at the time that the air superiority drones can be seen as one of the most cutting-edge weapons and equipment in the entire aerial unmanned combat formations. This type of drone has strong independent aerial combat capabilities. From a global perspective, this type of unmanned equipment is leading and pioneering, capable of overturning the existing air combat scenarios and profoundly change future air combat mode.</p><p>Zhang said that manned-unmanned teaming is both a concept and a future development trend, as major military powers are all striving to compete in this domain, with the US and China both in leading positions.</p><p>\"To a certain extent, manned-unmanned teaming operations are gradually transitioning from concept to reality and will significantly impact the form of future warfare,\" Zhang said.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Chinese, US, UK, and Saudi Arabia scientists reconstructed high quality and long-term natural streamflow of 217,001 river reaches across China and analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of natural river flow connectivity during 1961-2020, emphasizing warming climate and water withdrawals threaten river flow connectivity in China, and highlighting the urgent need to maintain sustainable water resources, particularly in drying regions, the Global Times learned from a research team of the Beijing Normal University on Wednesday.</p><p>The related research was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), the Global Times learned.</p><p>Those scientists are from the Beijing Normal University, Peking University, University of California, Bohai University, China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, University of Oxford, The University of Edinburgh, and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.</p><p>According to the research team, the river flow connectivity, widely defined as the flow status and carrying capacity of a river and is associated with a range of important ecological and societal benefits, plays a pivotal role in ecosystem sustainability, regional socioeconomic development, and human well-being. Natural river flow connectivity is highly sensitive to changes in aridity, which is vulnerable even to small changes in climate, especially during prolonged droughts. Furthermore, as one of the fastest growing countries and the world's second-largest economy, China has experienced a doubling of water consumption from 1965 to 2013.</p><p>In the context of accelerated climate change, the effects of warming climate and human water abstraction on the spatial-temporal variation of river flow connectivity have yet to be fully investigated. In China, connectivity has only been examined for individual basins, and there is a lack of information on the number of intermittent rivers flowing through different hydroclimatic zones, the scientists noted.</p><p>According to the joint study, the estimated naturally intermittent rivers represent about 13 percent of all river reaches, with a large contrast between northern and southern China. Although river intermittency decreased slightly during this period, warming temperatures offset this decrease by reducing surface water persistence, causing the decrease to double when removing the long-term temperature trend.</p><p>The scientists then analyzed whether a given river can meet water consumption and environmental flow requirements. According to Gou Jiaojiao, a team member, the length of intermittent rivers increased remarkably when considering human water withdrawal by agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors, in addition to environmental flow requirements.</p><p>Consequently, Miao Chiyuan, the team leader, called for urgent efforts to maintain sustainable water resources, particularly in drying regions, prompting the study to discuss potential solutions.</p><p>Global Times</p>",

In May, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the US Department of Commerce issued an announcement regarding the use of Huawei's Ascend chips as a \"violation of US export controls\", and warned the public of the potential consequences of allowing the use of US AI chips for training Chinese AI models.</p><p>However, despite the US' persistent suppression, domestic Chinese AI products have achieved significant breakthroughs in terms of application, reaching parameter scales in the hundreds of billions and achieving multi-modal capabilities. They have been deeply integrated into scenarios such as office collaboration, education, industrial design and content creation, forming an intelligent application ecosystem covering multiple fields, according to a report released by the China Internet Network Information Center on Monday.</p><p>Facts have proven that monopolizing technologies and resorting to protectionist threats to contain China's AI capabilities are all unfeasible and counterproductive approaches, which will ultimately hinder the fundamental development of the US' own AI sector, Bao said. He stressed that China's vast market and enormous AI potential provide great opportunities for US companies like Nvidia.</p><p>\"Globalization is an inevitable trend. The wide participation of enterprises, scholars and officials from across the world at the WAIC demonstrates the robust vitality of international AI cooperation while also underscoring that open cooperation and exchanges are the future of global AI,\" he said.</p>",
